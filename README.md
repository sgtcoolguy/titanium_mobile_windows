# Titanium Mobile Windows

Titanium Mobile Windows is the Titanium platform support for the Microsoft Windows 8.1 Store and Phone platforms.

## Prerequisites

```bash
git clone https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows.git
pushd titanium_mobile_windows
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Windows

Step 1. Install Visual Studio 2013

Step 2. Install this version of [CMake](https://cmakems.codeplex.com/releases/view/126914) in order to generate VS 2013 project files.

Step 3. Install [64-bit Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe).

* Choose the mirror http://mirrors.kernel.org which we have measured is at least 100x faster than the default selected mirror.
* Select both ```curl``` and ```unzip``` in addition to the defaults.

Step 4. Install JavascriptCore

Download our pre-compiled version of JavascriptCore [JavaScriptCore-Windows-1411436814.zip (276 MB)](http://timobile.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/jscore/JavaScriptCore-Windows-1411436814.zip), unzip anywhere (the location doesn't matter) and set the environment variable JavaScriptCore_HOME to where you unzipped it.

Just run the following commands from your Cygwin bash prompt to setup your development environment for JavaScriptCore_HOME before
proceeding:

```bash
$ curl -O http://timobile.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/jscore/JavaScriptCore-Windows-1411436814.zip
$ unzip JavaScriptCore-Windows-1411436814.zip
```

step 5. Install Google Test

Download our pre-compiled version of Google Test [gtest-1.7.0-windows.zip (3 MB)](http://timobile.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/gtest-1.7.0-windows.zip), unzip anywhere (the location doesn't matter) and set the environment variable GTEST_ROOT to where you unzipped it.

Just run the following commands from your Cygwin bash prompt to setup your development environment for Google Test before proceeding:

```bash
$ curl -O http://timobile.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/gtest-1.7.0-windows.zip
$ unzip gtest-1.7.0-windows.zip
```

Step 6. Install Boost

Microsoft officially supports and encourages the use of the Boost C++ open source library for Windows Store and Windows Phone apps, and they have contributed a great deal of open source code to the Boost project. Please read the Microsoft article [Using Boost Libraries in Windows Store and Phone Applications](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2014/07/18/using-boost-libraries-in-windows-store-and-phone-applications.aspx) and follow their instructions.

Microsoft instructs us to create the folders named WPSDK\WP81 under the VC Visual Studio installation directory, `C:\Program Files
(x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\`, and copy their [phone setup script files](http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-components-postattachments/00-10-54-33-32/BoostSample-.zip) to it. This has been verified to work well with our CMake build infrastructure.

After following Microsoft's instructions, define the environment variable `BOOST_ROOT` to point to where you cloned the boost git repository and add it to your `PATH`. If you are using PowerShell something like the following works:
```
setx.exe BOOST_ROOT $env:HOME\Documents\GitHub\boost
$env:Path += ";$env:BOOST_ROOT";
cd $env:BOOST_ROOT\libs\thread\build
b2 toolset=msvc-12.0 link=static windows-api=store
b2 toolset=msvc-12.0 link=static windows-api=phone
```

Step 7. Install SQLite

Download our pre-compiled version of SQLite [SQLite-Windows-1415143965334.zip (8 MB)](http://timobile.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/SQLite-Windows-1415143965334.zip), unzip anywhere (the location doesn't matter) and set the environment variable SQLite_HOME to where you unzipped it.

Just run the following commands from your Cygwin bash prompt to setup your development environment for SQLite_HOME before proceeding:

```bash
$ curl -O http://timobile.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/SQLite-Windows-1415143965334.zip
$ unzip SQLite-Windows-1415143965334.zip
```

### OS X

Step 1. Install Xcode 6

Step 2. Install cmake using either `sudo port install cmake` or `sudo brew install cmake`.

Step 3. Install boost using either `sudo port install boost` or `sudo brew install boost`.

Step 4. Download our pre-compiled version of Google Test [gtest-1.7.0-osx.zip (3 MB)](http://timobile.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/gtest-1.7.0-osx.zip), unzip anywhere (the location doesn't matter) and set the environment variable GTEST_ROOT to where you unzipped it.

Just run the following commands from your bash prompt to setup your development environment for Google Test before proceeding:

```bash
$ curl -O http://timobile.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/gtest-1.7.0-osx.zip
$ unzip gtest-1.7.0-osx.zip
```

## Getting Started

After installing the prerequisites you should try to build our
reference app NG. We recommend performing out-of-source builds,
so to do this run the script Scripts/generate_vs_project.sh from any
directory of your choosing as long as it is not within the
titanium_mobile_windows git repo. A good place might be
`C:\Users\<user name>\Documents\Visual Studio 2013`. For example:

```bash
pushd "${HOME}/Documents/Visual Studio 2013/"
"${HOME}/Documents/GitHub/titanium_mobile_windows/Tools/Scripts/generate_vs_project.sh" Pedro
cygstart Pedro.WindowsPhone.Win32/Pedro.sln
```
